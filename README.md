## About

**BTx** is a modern Elixir library for Bitcoin development, starting with a
powerful JSON-RPC client for Bitcoin Core. Designed for developers building
Bitcoin applications, `BTx` provides an idiomatic Elixir interface with plans
to expand into comprehensive Bitcoin tooling.

## Features

- **Full JSON-RPC Compliance**: Complete implementation of Bitcoin Core's
  JSON-RPC API.
- **Idiomatic Elixir Interface**: Clean, functional API that feels natural
  in Elixir applications.
- **Configurable Client**: Built on Tesla for flexible HTTP client
  configuration.
- **Automatic Encoding**: Bitcoin methods automatically encoded using Ecto
  embedded schemas.
- **Response Handling**: Intelligent response parsing and error handling.

## Installation

Add `btx` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:btx, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Quick Start

The first step is to ensure that you have a Bitcoin node running locally.
You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file in the repo to spin up the Bitcoin
node (running in `regtest` mode), like so:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Now we can start using the JSON RPC API. Let's create a wallet:

```elixir
iex> BTx.JRPC.client(
...>   base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:18443",
...>   username: "my-user",
...>   password: "my-pass"
...> )
...> |> BTx.JRPC.Wallets.create_wallet!(
...>   wallet_name: "my-wallet",
...>   passphrase: "my-passphrase",
...>   avoid_reuse: true,
...>   descriptors: true
...> )
%BTx.JRPC.Response{
  id: "btx-9cdb7b45-2dc0-4f2e-8d7b-664a03482ca1",
  result: %{"name" => "my-wallet"}
}
```

## Roadmap

BTx is under active development with plans to expand beyond JSON-RPC:

- **Phase 1** (Current): Complete JSON-RPC client implementation
- **Phase 2**: Wallet management utilities
- **Phase 3**: Transaction building and signing
- **Phase 4**: Blockchain analysis and utilities
- **Phase 5**: Advanced Bitcoin primitives

## Development Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: `BTx` is currently under active development. While the
core JSON-RPC functionality is being implemented, the API may change between
versions. Not recommended for production use yet.
